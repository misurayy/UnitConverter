# UnitConverter

A simple, beginner-friendly Java program that converts between units of the seven fundamental SI quantities: length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity.

# Key Features

Comprehensive Coverage of SI Base Units
Supports conversions for all seven fundamental physical quantities:

Length (meters ↔ kilometers)

Mass (kilograms ↔ grams)

Time (seconds ↔ minutes)

Electric Current (amperes ↔ milliamperes)

Temperature (kelvin ↔ Celsius)

Amount of Substance (moles ↔ millimoles)

Luminous Intensity (candelas ↔ millicandelas)

- Simple and Intuitive User Interface
Uses console input/output with clear menus and prompts to guide users through unit selections and conversions.

- No Use of Complex Libraries or Built-in Conversion Functions
Demonstrates basic programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, control flow (switch-case), and user input handling without relying on external libraries.

- Beginner-Friendly Codebase
Well-commented and structured code to help new programmers understand fundamental programming constructs and unit conversion logic.

# Importance and Uses

- Educational Tool
This project is ideal for beginners learning Java programming, especially those interested in practical applications like unit conversions. It reinforces understanding of variables, conditionals, user input, and arithmetic operations.

- Fundamental Science and Engineering Applications
Unit conversions are essential in scientific calculations, engineering designs, and everyday measurements. This program covers the base SI units, which are foundational to all physical measurements.

- Foundation for More Complex Converters
This code can be easily extended to include more units, more complex conversions (e.g., velocity, force, energy), or a graphical user interface (GUI).

# Impact

- Promotes Understanding of SI Units
By explicitly converting between units, users gain a better grasp of the International System of Units (SI) and how different units relate to each other.

- Encourages Good Programming Practices
The program’s clear structure and comments encourage writing readable, maintainable code — a critical skill for all developers.

- Supports STEM Education
Provides a practical coding example that bridges programming with physics and engineering concepts, supporting interdisciplinary learning.
